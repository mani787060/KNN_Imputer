# Project: KNN Imputer

-> This project focuses on handling missing data using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation — a technique that fills in missing values using the nearest neighbors’ feature values.
-> It also includes a comparison with traditional Mean Imputation using Scikit-learn’s SimpleImputer.

## Highlights:-
 
-> Implementation of KNN Imputer from sklearn.impute
-> Comparison with Mean Imputation using SimpleImputer
-> Understand how neighborhood-based imputation preserves data patterns
-> Visualization of before/after imputation effects
-> Works for both numerical and mixed datasets

## Libraries Used:- 
 
-> pandas
-> numpy
-> sklearn
-> matplotlib
-> seaborn

## Goal:-
 
-> To understand the working of KNN-based imputation and compare its performance with mean imputation in terms of data distribution and feature relationships.
